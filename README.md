### System Workflow

- **Employee Portal**: Employees log in and set their working preferences.
- **Manager Portal**: Managers define available schedules.
- **Schedule Generation**: Manager clicks 'Generate,' triggering an API call to the Next.js backend.
- **Data Processing**: Next.js backend sends employee data to the FastAPI microservice.
- **Optimization**: FastAPI microservice generates an optimized schedule considering constraints.
- **Final Adjustments**: The generated schedule is returned to the frontend, where managers can make final tweaks.
- **Publishing**: Once finalized, the schedule is saved to Firebase and shared with employees in real-time.
